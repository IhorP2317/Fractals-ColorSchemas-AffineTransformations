                    <h2>Fractals</h2>
                    <p>Fractals are complex geometric shapes or patterns that exhibit self-similarity, meaning they
                        contain smaller copies of themselves at various scales. These intricate structures are generated
                        through recursive mathematical equations and are often characterized by their fine, detailed,
                        and irregular features. Fractals have applications in various fields, including mathematics,
                        art,
                        computer graphics, and natural phenomena modeling.</p>

                    <h2>Color Schemes</h2>
                    <p>Color schemes, also known as color palettes or color harmonies, refer to organized
                        combinations of colors chosen for design or artistic purposes. These schemes are created to
                        achieve visual harmony and convey specific emotions or messages. Common color schemes
                        include monochromatic (using variations of a single color), complementary (combining colors
                        opposite each other on the color wheel), analogous (using colors adjacent to each other on
                        the color wheel), and triadic (selecting three evenly spaced colors on the color wheel), among
                        others. Effective use of color schemes is essential in graphic design, interior decorating, and
                        various forms of visual communication.</p>

                    <h2>Shape Transformation</h2>
                    <p>Shape transformation, in the context of mathematics and computer graphics, involves altering
                        the size, position, orientation, or deformation of geometric shapes. This process is typically
                        achieved through a series of mathematical operations or transformations, such as translation
                        (moving a shape to a different location), rotation (changing the orientation of a shape),
                        scaling (resizing a shape), and shear (distorting a shape by stretching or tilting). Shape
                        transformation is fundamental in computer-aided design (CAD), animation, and computer
                        graphics to create dynamic and visually appealing images or models. It plays a crucial role in
                        simulating real-world movements and transformations in digital environments.</p>
